<p>Test your memory with this memory game. First select the difficulty level. The higher the number, the more cards are
    in the memo game. On the game board, there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. Then
    try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be
    flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you
    play. When you find a pair they are removed from the board and when you find all the pairs in this memory, you have
    completed the level.</p>
